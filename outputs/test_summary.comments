In 2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide. Ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is now forced to work as a farmer with his son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald. He observes a pattern formed by an apparent gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom. He decodes it into GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains that NASA is trying to find an exoplanet capable of supporting life. He enlists Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft called the Endurance, holding the supplies and embryos for a new colony potentially without the population of Earth. After reaching their destination, the crew investigates three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, with each previously checked by a NASA scientist-explorer.
